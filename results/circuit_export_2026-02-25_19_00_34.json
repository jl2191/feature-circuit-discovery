  "context": "This is a feature circuit extracted from the transformer language model google/gemma-2-2b. Each node represents a feature learned by a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's residual stream at a specific layer. SAE features are interpretable directions in activation space; their 'desc' field (when available) is an auto-generated natural language description of what inputs cause that feature to activate. Each edge represents the gradient of a downstream SAE feature's activation with respect to an upstream SAE feature's activation, computed across the prompts listed in metadata. A positive gradient (excitatory) means increasing the upstream feature's activation tends to increase the downstream feature's activation; a negative gradient (inhibitory) means the opposite. Larger absolute gradient values indicate stronger functional connections. The 'score' on each node is the ranking metric used to select which features to display (total gradient influence, logit gradient, or activation frequency depending on the mode).\n\nThe prompts used to compute this circuit are listed in metadata.prompts. Features that are consistently active across these prompts and strongly connected to each other likely form a functional circuit relevant to the shared task structure of those prompts. Logit nodes (if present) represent specific output tokens; edges to logit nodes show how strongly each feature influences the probability of that token being predicted.",
